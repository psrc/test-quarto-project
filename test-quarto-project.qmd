## Quarto Set-up

Create a new Quarto project by clicking on File > New Project.

A Quarto project will include a `.qmd` file as well as a `_quarto.yml`.

Install the `renv` package if it hasn't been installed yet. This package creates a reproducible environment for your R projects.

Run `renv::init()` at the root of your project directory. It will create a `renv.lock` file that takes a snapshot of all the dependencies in your project.

Create `.github/workflows` directory.

## Create new empty Github repository

Sync it with your local directory
